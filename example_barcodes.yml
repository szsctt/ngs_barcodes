- sample: 
    type: constant
    mismatches: 0 #number of mismatches to allow in barcode.  mismatches > 0 will be much slower than mismatches == 0
    start: 0 #expected start base of this barcode in the read
    barcodes:
        plasmid: CGTAG
        vector: TCCTA

- insertions:
    type: variable # read contains an insertion of unknown length, but must contain the 'before' sequence before the insertion and the 'after' sequence after the insertion
    mismatches: 0 # number of mismatches to allow in before/after sequences.  mismatches > 0 will slow down the script a lot. More than one mismatch is not recommended
    before: GCCAATCA # sequence that precedes insertion
    after: GGAGCTTC #sequence that occurs after insertion
